# MMS OBJECT CONFIGURATION FILE
# This file is used as input to the 'foundry' utility application.
# It is used to create the following objects for use with MMS-LITE:
#	Types
#	Domains
#	Named Variables
#	Named Variable Lists
#
# Note: All objects except for the types can also be created 
#       by user code at initialization time. The creation of the
#	Domains, Variables, and Variable Lists via this utility
#	is for convenience only.
#
# Lines beginning with pound-signs are comments and are ignored.
# The general format of object definitions in this file is described 
# below. All object definition information is supplied in quotes, and
# can span multiple lines if desired. A object definition string is of 
# the form :
#
#   "{objectType}","Object Specific String1", "String2", ...
#
# Where the objectType field is used to specify the object and some of 
# it's optional attributes. The format of the 'objectType' field is as 
# follows -
#
# 	":X{flags}"
#
# Where X is one of the set {I,T,D,V,L}, and the set of valid flag
# characters depends on the object type.
#
# 	C == Control string
# 	  Flags  
# 	    C : Config, next string is alignment file to use
# 	    P : Path, next string is include path for ODF files
# 	    F : Flags, next string contains flags to set defaults
#		":VD"
#		":VP"
#		":TU"
#		":TT"
#		":TV"
#		"-notypedefs"
#		"-nosuffix"
# 	    U : UCA control, next string contains UCA control info
#		"MVL_UCA"
#		"MVLU_USE_REF"
#
# 	I == User specified include file, for user object definitions
# 	  Flags  
#           None
#
# 	T == Type
# 	  Flags  
# 	    U : Unique, do not 'twin' this type
# 	    T : Transient type, do not keep
# 	    V : Keep only if referenced by a variable
# 	    K : Keep this type unconditionally
#
# 	D == Domain
# 	  Flags  
#           None
#
# 	V == Named Variable
# 	  Flags  
#           D : Use 3rd string to set data pointer
#           P : Use 4th (3rd for no D) string to set processing fun
#           U : Use 5th (4rd for no D, 3rd for no P) string to set usr_info
#
# 	L == Named Variable List
# 	  Flags  
#           U : Use 5th (4rd for no D, 3rd for no P) string to set usr_info
#          String ":S" : End of list of variables
#
# 	N == UCA Model Name Generation 
# 	  Flags  
#           None
